                    <p> Eunice Mun, the founder of A+ Nail School, 
                        has been successful in the nail business for more 
                        than ten years. Beginning in 2004, she established 
                        her first nail salon in Chicago area,  followed by 
                        a second salon later the same year. 
                        In 2013, she bought A+ Nail School school specializing in nail techniques. 
                        Eunice Mun’s inspiration for A+ Nail School was to 
                        train nail technicians and also teachers who could 
                        expend the number of qualified nail technicians. 
                        She saw that being a nail technician as an opportunity 
                        to earn a regular income and grow as an individual and 
                        business person. Nail technician would find many job 
                        opportunities or could become successful, self-employed 
                        business owner.
